#use more function for this for greater modularity
#question, cards do not need to be the argument for this to work. However, if ComputerCards and PlayerCards is not a local variable inside the function
#(or it is not an argument for the function if those 2 variables were defined outside the function), there would be an error. why? wtf? that's... inconsistent

############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.
