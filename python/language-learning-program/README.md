# Language Learning Program

Language Learning Program. An English language learning application that features three main components: a vocabulary test containing exercises for translating words from English to Indonesian, a grammar test consisting of "fill in the blank" exercises using a multiple-choice system, and a listening test with questions whose answers are found in an audio that can only be played once. Vocabulary data, sentence patterns, and audio are independently created and stored in a database. There is a login feature, allowing each user to save their learning progress and view analytics data on their progress. Additionally, there is an experience and level system for each user based on correct or incorrect answers in each exercise.

## Additional Info

2. This program is unfinished, there is one feature in the dashboard to show daily progress of a user which were not finished on time.
3. Pydub requires ffmpeg. So you would need to have that installed on your virtual environment for this program to run.
