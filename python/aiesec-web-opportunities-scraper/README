A program I made to help automate a task for my AIESEC in UI's team implementing OOP, Sheety API, and Selenium Web Scraping.
AIESEC has a website with hundreds of internship opportunities posted there. One task that my team in AIESEC needs to do is to look up as much of opportunities posted as possible and filter them to find the
most recommended opportunities to share to our customers. This task is done weekly and usually takes a few hours to complete. An idea emerge from me to create program that would automate this task so that we just have
to run the program and all the recommended opportunities will be uploaded to a gheets that the team can then use to recommend to customers only just for a few minutes. This program made it possible for us to look up all 
hundreds of opportunities to filter where previously it would only be less than a hundred considering it is done by humans.
I am pretty happy with how it turned out since I made this program in a day only, eventhough I am aware that there are lots of improvements that could be made here.
An improvement I might made in the future would be to add GUI to the program so that my colleagues can have an easier time using this program.
Here is the output from the google sheets of all the opportunities that have been filtered if you're interested: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LL652xTTrggstltMKQFEZegAe4IlPOXTFzYXj-Yag8I/edit?usp=sharing
