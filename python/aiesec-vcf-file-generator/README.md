This is another program made to automate AIESEC in UI's task.
One of my department's routine was to contact customers who have recently signed up to our aiesec website via WhatsApp. The problem is that it there are a lot of customers that we needed to contact. Usually, we would need to save around 20+ phone numbers to our phone at a time. That's a bit taxing considering we needed to do this regularly.

So, knowing that there is a file format .vcf which can store multiple contact information and you can save those contact information by just clicking the .vcf file on your phone, I decided to create a python program to automate these tasks. The details are as follows:
1. Users would need to input the contact information into a google sheet and then download them as a .csv file.
2. The .csv will then be uploaded into the program.
3. The .vcf file created will be sent to the users' email which can then be accessed using your phone to save those contact information instantly with a just one click.
4. The program created contains detailed instructions since a lot of my collagues are not familiar with google colab and programming.
