A simple but fun GUI game where you have to make your turtle cross the street full of cars without getting hit.
Just press the forward arrow key to move :DD and enjoy.

Details:
1. Uses Turtle packages for the graphics.
2. OOP style.
3. The biggest challenge was to create the algorithm for the moving cars because it requires a good enough randomization to make the game fun.
