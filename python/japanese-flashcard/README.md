I'm learning japanese. So I decided to try and create a Japanese flash card app to make my study more fun!
The program will show a japanese word for a few seconds and then it will show the translation in English. You can have an option to click the check button which means you have remembered the word and would like to have the word not shown anymore or the x button which means you haven't remembered them yet.

Details:
1. I searched up 100 of the most commonly used words in Japan for this program.
2. The challenge for this program is that I haven't learned japanese alphabets yet during the creation of this program (Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji). So I use Pykakasi module from the internet to convert words in Japanese characters to Latin Alphabets.
3. Uses Tkinter package for the GUI.
