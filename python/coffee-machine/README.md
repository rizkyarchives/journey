My first OOP project where I simulate the workings of a coffee vending machine.

Details:
1. When the program is run, it will start with a predetermined amount of Coffee, Milk, and Water ingredients,
2. User can choose to order latte, espresso, or cappucino where the three has different amount of ingredients requirement and price.
3. Once ordered, the amount of ingredients will be subtracted accordingly.
4. You can check the amount of ingredients left and the total money created from the vending machine.
