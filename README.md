# journey
All my coding journey compiled into one repository that I'd like to share with you. Ideas of the programs I made mostly came from the courses that I took. I mostly do this as a hobby for now :D.
I've learned C, Python, and a bit of html+css. If you're curious on what courses I took to learn these programs, here it is:
Python: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
C: https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/
Since I am a learner, If you're interested in giving me feedback on my past codes, please do! I'd appreciate it.
