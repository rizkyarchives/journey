# journey

My coding learning experiences compiled into one repository that I'd like to share with you. Ideas for the programs I made mostly came from the courses that I took. I might filter and clean up this repository in the future when I've made more programs. I mostly do this as a hobby for now :D.
I've learned C, Python, and a bit of html+css. If you're curious about what courses I took to learn these programs, here it is:
Python: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
C: https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/
Since I am a learner, if you're interested in giving me feedback on my past code, please do! I'd appreciate it.
